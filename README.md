# Problem Statement
In the contemporary digital landscape, freelance photographers often encounter significantdifficulties when seeking potential clients, while clients themselves struggle to find the rightphotographers for their specific needs. This disconnect within the photography industry creates inefficiencies and hampers the growth and success of freelance photographers and the satisfaction of clients. To address this critical challenge, our project, Photography Hub, is dedicated to providing a solution. We aim to create a user-friendly platform that simplifies the process for freelance photographers to connect with clients, and simultaneously offers clients a convenient way to discover and engage skilled photographers.
